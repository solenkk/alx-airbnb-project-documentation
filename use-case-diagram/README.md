  - Payment updates

---

### 8. **Admin Dashboard**

- Admin features include:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. **Database Management**

- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Tables to include:

  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

---

### 2. **API Development**

- Use **RESTful APIs** for CRUD operations
  - HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`

---

### 5. **Third-Party Services**

- Email notifications via:
  - SendGrid or Mailgun

---

### 6. **Error Handling and Logging**

- Support horizontal scaling with load balancers

---

### 2. **Security**

- Encrypt sensitive user data
- Implement rate limiting and firewalls
- Sanitize inputs to avoid SQL injection/XSS
